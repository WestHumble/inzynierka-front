# Tunnel setup

If expo is not working normally you can use its tunnelling feature
Open local tunnel to server port: lt --port 81
Copy name and place it in .env under EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL
Init expo with tunnel: yarn expo start --tunnel

IF STILL DOESN'T WORK:
enter the link and fill in you ip address to allow trafic (there is a link providing your ip)
